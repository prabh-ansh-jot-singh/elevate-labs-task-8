## 📚 Summary: VPN Benefits & Limitations

### ✅ Benefits
- Encrypts internet traffic via secure tunneling protocols.
- Masks real IP address, enhancing anonymity.
- Protects data on public Wi-Fi networks.
- Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship.

### ⚠️ Limitations
- May reduce browsing speed due to encryption overhead.
- Free VPNs can have limited server options and bandwidth.
- VPNs do not guarantee complete anonymity—logs and leaks are possible.
- Some websites block VPN traffic.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** Creates a secure tunnel between user and internet.
- **Encryption:** Converts data into unreadable format to prevent interception.
- **Protocols:** Common ones include OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2.
- **Privacy:** VPNs hide IP and location but don’t make users invisible online.
